# Node.js and MariaDB Project with Docker
This project demonstrates a simple Node.js application using the Express framework and MariaDB for handling GET and POST requests related to tasks. 
Additionally, it includes Docker and Docker Compose configuration for containerisation. 
I'll be explaining each stage and how to deploy if you'd just want to use this as a demo. 

## Prerequisites
Docker installed
Docker Compose installed
